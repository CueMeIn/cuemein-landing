    role: "Job Readiness Trainee"
    content: "I'm currently learning job readiness training. While hard skills can be built through certifications or experience, soft skills like customer service and social skills are different. They're learned through interpersonal relationships and interactions with friends, which can be challenging for people with ASD. But CueMeIn's scenarios are realistic yet safe for practicing with AI, and the constructive feedback makes it exceptional."

## The Question That Changed Everything

Several years ago, when I was meeting with staff from NOVA Transition to help find the right workplace for my son, a simple question opened an unexpected door. "What are his strengths?" they asked. My son hesitated for a long moment, and in that silence, I found myself answering: "He thrives on patterns—he loves working with patterns."

I had known this about him for years, but in that moment, something deeper stirred within me. A question began to form, quietly at first, then with growing intensity: _Why do autistic people love patterns so much?_

Carl R. Rogers once wrote, "The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change." Perhaps this curiosity about my son's mind was the beginning of accepting—and truly understanding—the beautiful complexity of how autistic minds work.

## The Science Behind the Gift

What began as a father's curiosity led me into the fascinating world of neuroscience research. What I discovered was both profound and illuminating: autistic individuals possess extraordinarily developed systematising abilities—a neurological operating system that seeks to understand the world through rules, patterns, and organisational structures.

This systematising mechanism is not merely a preference or a learned behavior; it is a fundamental way the autistic brain processes information. Where neurotypical minds might see chaos or randomness, autistic minds instinctively search for underlying order, connections, and meaning. They are natural archaeologists of pattern, excavating sense from complexity with remarkable speed and accuracy.

Professor Simon Baron-Cohen's groundbreaking research at Cambridge University reveals that autistic individuals can detect patterns 40% faster than their non-autistic peers. His studies show that many autistic people possess what he terms "Type S" or "Extreme Type S" brain types—minds that excel at systematising but may find social empathy more challenging. These are not deficits; they are different configurations of human intelligence, each with its own gifts and perspectives.

The genetic research is equally compelling. Scientists have discovered significant hereditary connections between autistic traits and systematising abilities, suggesting that this pattern-seeking tendency is woven into the very fabric of autistic neurology. It's not something that needs to be fixed or overcome—it's a feature, not a bug, of these remarkable minds.

## The Lens Through Which They See

Think about your own relationship with patterns. When you listen to music, you naturally follow the rhythm. When you learned multiplication tables, you relied on patterns to make sense of numbers. We all seek patterns; it's human nature. But for autistic individuals, this search is amplified, refined, and extraordinarily sensitive.

They see the world through what I call "the pattern lens"—a way of perceiving that reveals connections others miss, structures others overlook, and meaning others might dismiss as coincidence. This isn't just about numbers or data; it's about seeing the hidden architecture of reality itself.

Consider the fictional but brilliantly portrayed lawyer Woo Young-woo from the Korean Netflix drama series. While fiction, her character demonstrates something profoundly real about autistic pattern recognition. In a crucial courtroom moment during an intellectual property dispute between ATM companies, opposing counsel displayed two technical diagrams on the screen, arguing they were "identical products using stolen technology."

Where everyone else in the courtroom—judges, lawyers, observers—saw two virtually identical designs, Young-woo's pattern-recognition lens revealed something significantly different. In the span of thirty seconds, while others were still processing the visual similarity, she had already detected the crucial differences that would determine the case.

"These two designs may appear similar at first glance," she declared, "but there are clear distinctions. The bill-weighing sensors in the Ewha ATM's cassette design are far more sophisticated and segmented than those in the American company's version. This isn't a case of copying existing technology—this represents genuine technological advancement and innovation."

What appeared to others as nearly identical technologies revealed itself to her trained eye as a story of meaningful engineering evolution. Her autistic mind, wired to detect patterns and discrepancies that others miss, saw not theft but innovation in the subtle differences between sensor configurations.

To her colleagues, it was just another legal case. To her, it was a narrative where international trade shows, cultural specificity, and engineering solutions converged in a meaningful pattern that ultimately determined the case's outcome.

## The Workplace Advantage

This gift of pattern recognition translates powerfully into professional advantages, particularly in our increasingly complex, data-rich world. Autistic individuals often excel in fields where others struggle precisely because they can see what others cannot.

In software development, they spot bugs that hide in plain sight. In quality control, they notice inconsistencies that others accept as normal variations. In financial analysis, they detect anomalies that could save companies millions. In research, they make connections between disparate fields that lead to breakthrough innovations.

Yet too often, we focus on what autistic individuals find challenging—social communication, sensory sensitivities, changes in routine—rather than celebrating and cultivating their extraordinary gifts. We see the accommodation needs without recognizing the superpowers.

## Discovering Your Pattern Recognition Abilities

If you are autistic, or if you recognise these traits in yourself, how can you identify and develop your own pattern recognition strengths? Here are some reflective questions to guide your self-discovery:

**Where do you naturally notice what others miss?**

- Do you spot inconsistencies in data that others overlook?
- Can you identify inefficiencies in systems or processes?
- Do you notice when designs or layouts feel "off" in ways others can't articulate?
- Are you sensitive to subtle differences in language, tone, or text?

**What kinds of patterns draw your attention?**

- Are you naturally drawn to numerical sequences or mathematical relationships?
- Do you notice patterns in human behavior or organisational dynamics?
- Are you good at predicting outcomes based on historical patterns?
- Do visual patterns, symmetries, or asymmetries capture your focus?

## A Week of Pattern Awareness

I encourage you to try this exercise: for one week, spend ten minutes each day recording moments when you think, "Something seems off here" or "I notice a pattern that others don't see." Don't judge these observations—simply document them.

At the week's end, review your notes. You may be surprised by the consistency of your insights, the areas where your pattern recognition naturally gravitates, and the potential value these observations could bring to your work and relationships.

## The Beauty of Different Minds

Henri Nouwen taught us that our wounds can become the source of our healing—not just for ourselves, but for others. Perhaps the same is true of neurological differences. The very traits that can make social situations challenging for autistic individuals—their intense focus on patterns, their need for precision, their sensitivity to inconsistencies—are exactly what our complex world needs.

In boardrooms where everyone thinks alike, the person who sees different patterns brings invaluable perspective. In laboratories where conventional wisdom prevails, the mind that questions underlying assumptions may discover the next breakthrough. In schools where standardised approaches dominate, the teacher who recognises learning patterns others miss may unlock a student's potential.

Your pattern recognition abilities are not quirks to be managed or minimised. They are gifts to be celebrated, developed, and shared. In a world increasingly driven by data, systems, and complex interconnections, minds that naturally see patterns are not just valuable—they are essential.

## Moving Forward

As I watched my son navigate his early career, I realised that my role wasn't to help him fit into existing patterns, but to help him—and others—recognise the extraordinary value of the patterns he naturally sees.

CueMeIn exists because we believe that workplaces need the unique perspectives that neurodivergent minds bring. We're not trying to fix anyone or make anyone "normal." We're working to help autistic individuals find environments where their pattern recognition abilities are not just accommodated, but actively valued and utilised.

Your mind sees things others cannot. Your patterns reveal truths others miss. Your systematic thinking solves problems others find impossible. These aren't consolation prizes—they are competitive advantages in a world that desperately needs people who can make sense of complexity.

The question isn't whether you have valuable pattern recognition abilities. If you're reading this and recognizing yourself in these words, you almost certainly do. The question is: how will you discover, develop, and deploy this gift in service of your own fulfillment and the world's greater good?

Your patterns matter. Your perspectives are needed. Your mind, exactly as it is, has something unique and valuable to offer.

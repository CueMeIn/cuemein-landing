## 📧 **EMAIL FORM STATUS**

### ✅ **Successfully Completed Today:**
1. **Updated layouts/index.html**: Added Netlify Forms integration
   - Form name: "early-access"
   - Added honeypot spam protection
   - Action: "/thank-you/" redirect

5. **Git Push Completed**: All changes deployed successfully
6. **Form Testing**: ✅ Email submission works (tested with amkadosh@yahoo.com.au)

### 🔍 **CURRENT ISSUE - Form Data Location:**
**Problem**: Cannot locate submitted email data
- **Expected**: Netlify Dashboard → Forms section
- **Reality**: Only found "cuemein-documentation" (wrong project)
- **Discovery**: Site actually hosted on VERCEL, not Netlify
- **Conflict**: Code has Netlify Forms but hosted on Vercel

### 🎯 **URGENT TASK FOR NEXT SESSION:**
**Locate Form Submission Data:**
1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**: 
   - Login to vercel.com
   - Find cuemein project
   - Check Functions/Analytics for form submissions
2. **Investigate Form Processing**:
   - Determine if Vercel processes Netlify form syntax
   - Check if data goes to external service (Formspree, etc.)
   - Verify email delivery mechanism
3. **Fix if Needed**:
   - Switch to Vercel Forms if available
   - Or implement proper Vercel-compatible form handler
